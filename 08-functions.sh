#!/bin/bash
# if we assign a name to some set of commands then it is called function.
# functions are used to keep code "DRY" (MEANS NO NEED TO REPEAT)
# FUNCTIONS are also used to group the commands logically
 # functions should always declare before using like variable
 # thats why functions are find at starting of the function
  # example beloe

function abc() {
  echi i am function of abc
}
