# This service is responsible for User Logins and Registrations Service in RobotShop e-commerce portal.

# This service is written in NodeJS, Hence need to install NodeJS in the system.

# Print "Installing nodejs"
# yum install nodejs make gcc-c++ -y &>>$LOG
# stat $?

# Let's now set up the User application.

# As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.

# So to run the User service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. Hence we will use roboshop as the username to run the service.

# Print "we need to add roboshop user"
# id roboshop &>>$LOG
# if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
#  echo "user already exists" &>>$LOG
# else
#  useradd roboshop &>>$LOG
# fi
# stat $?

# So let's switch to the roboshop user and run the following commands.

# Print "downloading the archiev-zip file"
# curl -s -L -o /tmp/user.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/user/archive/main.zip" &>>$LOG
# stat $?

# Print "Removing any old content"
# rm -rf /home/roboshop/user &>>$LOG
# stat $?


# Print "Unzipping the file"
# unzip -o -d /home/roboshop /tmp/user.zip &>>$LOG
# stat $?

# Print "copying to user file"
# mv /home/roboshop/user-main /home/roboshop/user &>>$LOG
# stat $?

# Print "installing dependencies"
# cd /home/roboshop/user
# npm install --unsafe-perm &>>$LOG
# stat $?

# Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.

# Print "update DNS records"
# sed -i -e 's/MONGO_DNSNAME/mongodb.roboshop.internal/' -e 's/REDIS_ENDPOINT/redis.roboshop.internal/' -e 's/'
# mv /home/roboshop/user/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/user.service
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl start user
# systemctl enable user
