# Let's now set up the catalogue application.

# As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.

# So to run the catalogue service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. Hence we will use roboshop as the username to run the service.
# we need to check user is there or not if we do many times it may face issue

NOTE: We need to update the IP address of MONGODB Server in systemd.service file
Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.

# mv /home/roboshop/catalogue/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl start catalogue
# systemctl enable catalogue
